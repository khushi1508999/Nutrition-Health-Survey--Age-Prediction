**Hackathon Project | Summer Analytics 2025**  
In collaboration with **Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati**

This project leverages a cleaned subset of the **NHANES** dataset to predict whether a U.S. citizen is a **Senior (65+)** or an **Adult (<65)** based on health and lifestyle indicators. The model uses 7 real-world features such as BMI, glucose levels, insulin, and activity response to classify age group with an F1-score as the evaluation metric.

## üìÇ About the Data

The data contains three CSV files:

- `train.csv` ‚Üí 2,016 labeled samples (with `age_group`: 0 for Adult, 1 for Senior)  
- `test.csv` ‚Üí 312 samples to predict  
- `sample-submission.csv` ‚Üí Format reference for submission

## üéØ Objective

Predict whether a respondent is:
- **Adult (0)** ‚Üí Age < 65  
- **Senior (1)** ‚Üí Age ‚â• 65

Submissions are evaluated on **F1-score**, with tie-breaking based on:
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìä Approach Summary

- üìå Handled missing values via imputation
- üìå Performed label encoding on categorical variables
- üìå Conducted thorough EDA on BMI, glucose, insulin, and gender distributions
- üìå Tried classification algorithms including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- üìå Tuned hyperparameters via GridSearchCV
- üìå Final predictions submitted as per required format (`sample-submission.csv`)

## üîç Evaluation & Rules

- Leaderboard is split:
  - **Public**: 50% of test set
  - **Private**: final 50% for final ranking
- Ensure submission format strictly matches `sample-submission.csv`
- Final leaderboard considers marked submissions only
